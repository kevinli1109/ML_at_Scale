    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",

    "__`NOTE`__: your reading assignment for weeks 5 and 6 were fairly heavy and you may have glossed over the papers on dimension independent similarity metrics by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf) and pairwise document similarity by [Elsayed et al](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~oard/pdf/acl08elsayed2.pdf).

    "> __a)__ Spark is an open-souce distributed cluster-computing framework. Spark is part of the Hadoop ecosystem and was built to overcome the limitations of MapReduce through techniques like in-memory processing. Spark shares many similarity with Hadoop MapReduce such as its adherence to funcitonal programming and its cluster architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Spark, similar to typical functional programming, computes lazily, contains immutable data, and allows higher order functions. But Spark allows side effects which are changes in state that depends on the function inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ DAGs are Directed Acyclic Graphs which are sets of vertices and edges in Spark, where vertices represent the RDDs and the eges representt he opration to to applied on RDD. On calling of Action, the created DAG is then submitted to DAG Scheduler which splits RDD into stages based on the transformation needed. It's useful to pay attention to the DAG because 1) it helps understand what records are being processed at which stage and 2) DAG can be customized to optimize the efficiency of thr Spark Job\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ If a RDD that will be called many times is a result of a series of transformation, using cache() might make more sense. Since transformations are lazily computed, everytime a RDD is called or needs to be materialized, the worker has go through the whole process of transformation that's needed to get to that RDD. If such an RDD is cached and stored in-memory, the worker doesn't have to trace back how it was created every time it's called. \n"

    "# Question 2: Similarity Metrics\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction to this assignment, an intuitive way to compare the meaning of two documents is to compare the list of words they contain. Given a vocabulary $V$ (feature set) we would represent each document as a vector of `1`-s and `0`-s based on whether or not it contains each word in $V$. These \"one-hot encoded\" vector representations allow us to use distance metrics to identify similar documents. However like many NLP tasks the high-dimensionality of the feature space is a challenge... especially when we start to scale up the size and number of documents we want to compare.\n",

    "# Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. Imagine for now that you have unlimited memory on each of your nodes and describe a sequence of map & reduce steps that would start from a raw corpus and reproduce your strategy from Q3. Be specific. For each step be sure to note what information would be stored in memory on your nodes and what information would need to be shuffled over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. Define each of these terms based on your reading of the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",

    "### Q4 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ In the mapper phase, each mapper scans through part of the corpus and constructs vector for each words in the corpus. These vectors are stored in-memory and store the words that occur within 5 word window. Then the vectors are sent to the reducers, in which the vectors are first combined (deduped), and then a vector for each words is constructed with 1-hot encoding and stored in memory, and then a loop goes through the vectors and computes the similarity between any two words. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ You can also just use an associative array where for each word, an array holds a unique list of its neighbors. In this way, 1) we don't need to store one value for each word in the total vocabulary like the 1-hot encoded vectors in-memory, and 2) much less information are being shuffled in the reduce phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ _read provided code before answering d-f_ \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ A posting is essentially an index for each word that has the format of <name of doc that the word is in, length of doc that the word is in>. Inverted index is just in the format of <word, posting>\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ `makeCompositeKeys` essentially emits all possible combinations (regardless of order) of 2 postings for the same word as key and 1 as the value. The new keys would contain information about which two documents have an overlapped word and the values can then be combined to compute the number of overlapped words in any two documents. And with the length of words (for each document) that are stored in the keys, Jaccard and Cosine similarity can be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ The mappers `splitWords`, `makeCompositeKey`, `jaccard` and the one lambda funciton `line` are all narrow transformation since data are transformed fron a single partition only. The `reduceByKey` are wide transformations since the data required for the computation may reside in many partitions of the parent RDD."

    "Now that you are comfortable with similarity metrics we turn to the main task in this assignment: Synonym Detection. As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which in any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary' (i.e. feature set). Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",

    "> __a)__ If we choose the 1000 most frequent words, since most of them also have a lot of neighbors, most of the words to build stripes with will end up have stripes that contain a lot of these words. So the stripes are going to have more overlap but the high overlap might not be telling of their similarity. On the other hand, if we use the 1000 least frequent words as our vocabulary, the stripes are going to have much fewer overlaps. Choosing the 1000 most frequent words can be thought of underfitting with low variance but high bias. And choosing the 1000 least frequent words can be thought of overfitting with high varaince but lower bias.\n",
